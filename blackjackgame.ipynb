    "## 1. \n",
    "## The game will have two players: the Dealer and the Player. The game will start off with a deck of 52 cards.\n",
    "## The 52 cards will consist of 4 different suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. For each suit, there will be cards numbered 1 through 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.\n",
    "## When the game begins, the dealer will shuffle the deck of cards, making them randomized. \n",
    "## After the dealer shuffles, it will deal the player 2 cards and will deal itself 2 cards from. \n",
    "## The Player should be able to see both of their own cards, but should only be able to see one of the Dealer's cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. \n",
    "## The objective of the game is for the Player to count their cards after they're dealt. \n",
    "## If they're not satisfied with the number, they have the ability to 'Hit'. A hit allows the dealer to deal the Player one additional card.\n",
    "## The Player can hit as many times as they'd like as long as they don't 'Bust'. \n",
    "## A bust is when the Player is dealt cards that total more than 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. \n",
    "## If the dealer deals the Player cards equal to 21 on the first deal, the Player wins. \n",
    "## This is referred to as Blackjack. Blackjack is NOT the same as getting cards that equal up to 21 after the first deal. \n",
    "## Blackjack can only be attained on the first deal\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. \n",
    "## The Player will never see the Dealer's hand until the Player chooses to 'stand'. \n",
    "## A Stand is when the player tells the dealer to not deal it anymore cards. \n",
    "## Once the player chooses to Stand, the Player and the Dealer will compare their hands. \n",
    "### Whoever has the higher number wins. Keep in mind that the Dealer can also bust.\n",
